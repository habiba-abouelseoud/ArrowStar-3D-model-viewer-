# The Library for the software application 

Group 04 would like to present ArrowStar, which is a cross platform software that allows the possibility of inspecting and observing many different 3D models. The software provides many beneficial aspects that will be dissected in the report. 
A user guide and an overview of the ArrowStar and its development to completion, that will discuss many unanswered questions such as, features, configuration, installing the software, and how to functionally use the software. 

# ArrowStar features: 
- Moving 3D models freely around both axes.
- Allowing multiple models to be present at the same time. 
- Allowing users to be able to modify the models by applying different features. 
- Allowing the user to independently make changes to the colour of the model and its background.
- Allowing User to view the model from different positions and applying shifting to it.
